### Neural Networks
    *  Perceptron - A 2 layer network used for simple operations
    *  Backpropagation Algorithm - used for multi-layer networks training.
    *  Deep Nets - Neural networks with 3 or more layers.
 
#### Perceptron
    *  Is a function that can decide whether an input, represented by a vector of numbers $(x_1, x_2, x_3, ... , x_n)$ often called input features, belongs to a specific class or not. The output of the perceptron will be 1 if it belongs to the specific class and 0 if not. Mathematically,

#### Multi-Layer Perceptron
    *  In a "dense" neural network every neuron in a layer is connected to all the neurons in the previous and following layers.
