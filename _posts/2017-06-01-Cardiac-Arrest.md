Clinical Pearls
===============
0. Caridact Arrest is defined as the cessation of cardiac mechanical activity confirmed by the absence of signs of circulation (eg. a detectable pulse, unresponsiveness, and apnea).

1. Survival rates are substantially higher in victims with a shockable first documented rhythm as one study reported survival rates of 49% with ventricular fibrillation/pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VF/PVT) versus 11% with pulseless electrical activity (PEA)/asystole.

2. Patients with VF/PVT were more likely to have myocardial infarction as the immediate factor pre-arrest while acute respiratory failure and hypotension were the immediate factors more commonly found in patients with PEA/asystole.

3. The most common clinical finding in adult patients who suffer cardiac-arrest is coronary artery disease. Cardiac arrest is the first clinical sign of coronary artery disease with no preceding signs or symptoms.

4. VF/PVT:
   Non-Pharmacologic Therapy:
     Electrical defibrillation is the only effective method of restoring a perfusing cardiac rhythm in either VF or PVT; therefore, it is a crucial link in the "chain of survival", espicially for a witnessed arrest. Although early defibrillation is crucial for survival following cardiac arrest, several studies have suggested that CPR prior to defibrillation may lead to more successful outcomes. 
   Pharmacologic Therapy: 
     i. Sympathomimetics:
        a. Epinephrine - recommended dose is 1mg administered by IV or intraosseous (IO) injection every 3 to 5 minutes. High dose epinephrine is not recommended for routine use in caridac arrest.
        b. Vasopressin
     ii. Antiarrhythmics
        a. Amiodarone - is the recommended antiarrhythmic in patients with VF or PVT, unresponsive to CPR, defibrillation, and vasopressor therapy.
        b. Lidocaine is currently recommended as an alternative to amiodarone, if amiodarone is not available.
     iii. Magnesium - Two observational trials have noted an improvement in ROSC (Return of spontaneous circulation) in patients with arrests associated with torsades de pointes.
     iv. Thrombolytics - Fibrinolytic therapy should not be used routinely in cardiac arrest but when pulmonary embolism is suspected, their use is suggested.

5. PEA/Asystole:
   Non-Pharmacologic Therapy:
     PEA is often caused by treatable conditions, and the resuscitation team needs to identify and correct these conditions emergently if the resuscitation is to be successful. Like PEA, successful treatment of asystole depends almost entirely on diagnosis of the underlying cause. Defibrillation should be avoided in patients with asystole because the parasympathetic discharge that occurs with defibrillation may reduce the chance of ROSC and worsen the chance of survival.
   Pharmacologic Therapy:
     i. Epinephrine.
     ii. Use of Vasopressin or Atropine is no longer recommended.
