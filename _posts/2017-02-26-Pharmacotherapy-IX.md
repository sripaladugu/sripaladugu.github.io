*  Cerebellum is located at the back of the brain. When looking at different cross-sections of brain 
use cerebellum as a reference point

### Anti-parkinson medications:
* Apomorphine causes significant nausea and vomiting
  - So much so that the manufacturer recommends taking an anti-emitic even before the first dose.
  - Tigan is the recommended anti-emitic
  - Metoclopramide and Compazine are not recommended because they are dopamine-receptor antagonists.
  - Zofran is contraindicated because of the risk of severe low blood pressure (hypotension) and fainting (loss of consciousness)
