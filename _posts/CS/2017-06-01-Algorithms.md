A. First choose a square tile with side the same as the breadth of the rectangle. Then fill the rectangle with similar size tiles. Whatever space is left in the rectangle, you choose a square tile with side the same as the breadth of the remaining space of the rectangle. Now if you continue this you will end up with a square tile whose side is the same as the GCD of breadth and length of the rectangle.
