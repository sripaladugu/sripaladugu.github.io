+  Introduction
   *  Heart Failure (HF) is a progressive clinical syndrome that can result from any abnormality in cardiac structure or function that impairs the ability of the ventricle to fill with or eject blood.
   *  Heart Failure can be caused by an abnormality in systolic function, diastolic funtion, or both. Making the distinction is important becuase the treatment of HF may be quite different depending on whether the predominant mechanism of the disorder is systolic or diastolic dysfunction.
   *  Disease that adversely affect ventricular diastole (filling), ventricular systole (contraction), or both can lead to HF.
   *  Historically it was believed that reduced myocardial contractility, or systolic dysfunction (i.e., reduced LVEF), now referred to as heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), was the sole disturbance in cardiac function responsible for HF.
   *  However recent estimates suggest that 50% of patients with HF have preserved LVEF (Left ventricular ejection fraction), referred to as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), with disturbaces in relaxation properties of the heart, or diastolic dysfunction.
   *  In contrast to HFrEF that is often caused by previous MI (caused by coronary artery disease), patients with HFpEF typically are elderly, female, and obese, and have hypertension (HTN), atrial fibrillation, or diabetes.
   *  Historically this disorder was commonly referred to as *congestive Heart Failure*; the preferred nomenclature now is HF since a patient may have syndrome of HF without having the symptoms of congestion.

+  Compensatory Mechanisms in HFrEF
   >Cardiac Output (CO) is defined as the volume of blood ejected per unit time (L/min) and is the product of heart rate (HR) and stroke volume (SV): CO = HR x SV
   >HFrEF is initiated by any event that impairs the ability of the heart to contract and sometimes relax resulting in a decrease in CO. The event may have an acute onset, as with MI, or the onset may be slow, as with long-standing HTN.
   *  Tachycardia and Increased contractility
      -  Primarily due to release of NE in response to a drop in CO
   *  Fluid Retension and Increased Preload
      -  Renal perfusion in HF is reduced due to both depressed CO and redistribution of blood away from nonvital organs. The kidney interprets the reduced perfusion as an ineffective blood volume, resulting in activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in an attempt to maintain BP and increase renal sodium and water retension.
   *  Vasoconstriction and Increased Afterload
      -  Secondary to reduced CO, vasoconstriction occurs in patients with HFrEF to help redistribute blood flow away from nonessential organs to heart and brain to support BP. Vasoconstriction impedes forward ejection of blood from the ventricle, further depressing CO and heightening the compensatory mechanisms.
