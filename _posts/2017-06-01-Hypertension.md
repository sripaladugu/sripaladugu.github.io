+  Etiology:
   >In most patients, hypertension results from unknown pathophysiologic etiology (essential or primary hypertension). This form of hypertension cannot be cured but can be controlled. A small percentage of patients have a specific cause of their hypertension (secondary hypertension. eg., CKD, Thyroid disease etc). Hypertension in these patients can be mitigated or potentially be cured.

+  Pathophysiology:
   >Multiple factors that control BP are potential contributing components in the development of essential hypertension. These include malfunctions in either humoral (ie. the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system [RAAS]) or vasodepressor mechansims, abnormal neuronal mechanisms, defects in peripheral autoregulation, and disturbances in sodium, calcium, and antriuretic hormones. Many of these factors are cumulatively affected by the multifaceted RAAS, which ultimately regulates arterial BP. It is probable that no one factor is solely responsible for essential hypertension.
  -  Arterial BP:
     >Arterial BP is the pressure in the arterial wall measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). The two identified arterial BP values are systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP). SBP represents the peak value, which is acheived during cardiac contraction. DBP is acheived after contraction when the cardiac chambers are filling, and represents the nadir value.
  -  Hypertensive Crises:
     >Hypertensive crises are clinical situations where there are extreme BP elevations, typically greater than 180/120 mm Hg. They are categorized either Hypertensive emergency (when accompanied by acute or progressive end-organ damage) orhypertensive urgency (when without acute or progressive end-organ injury).
  -  SBP is stronger predictor of CV disease than DBP in adults aged 50 years and older; it is the most important clinical BP parameter for most patients. 
  -  Harmonal Mechanisms:
     +  RAAS system
     +  Natriuretic Hormone
  -  Neuronal Regulation
     +  Stimulation of beta_1 receptors (which are predominantly in heart) results in an increase in heart rate (chronotropy) and force of contraction (ionotropy), whereas stimulation of beta_2 receptors (which are predominantly in bronchioles) results in the vasodilation of arterioles and venules.
     +  Baroreceptor reflex system.
  -  Peripheral Autoregulatory Components
     +  Kidneys can modulate the amount sodium and water retention depending on the blood pressure, malfunction of this system can also result in hypertension.
  -  Vascular Endothelial Mechanisms
     +  Nitric oxide is produced in the endothelium, relaxes the vascular epithelium, and is a very potent vasodilator. The nitric oxide system is an important regulator of arterial BP. Patients with hypertension may have an intrinsic nitric oxide deficiency, resulting in inadequate vasodilation.
  -  Electrolytes
     +  High Na intake is associated with hypertension. 

+  Pharmacotherapy
   -  See the flow chart 
   -  Verapamil and Diltiazem should be given very cautiously with beta-blocker because there is an increased risk of heart block with these combinations. When a CCB is needed in combination with a beta-blocker for BP lowering, a dihydropyridine should be selected because it will not increase risk of heart block.
   -  Thiazide induced hyperuricemia can precipitate gout. If gout does occur in patients who require thiazide therapy, allopurinol can be given to prevent gout and will not compromise the anti-hypertensive effects of thiazides.
   -  Abrupt cessation of beta blocker therapy can produce unstable Angina, MI, or even death in patients with coronary disease. To avoid this, beta-blockers shold always be tapered gradually over 1 or 2 weeks before eventually discontinuing the drug.
   -  Under no circumstance should two drugs from the exact class of medications be used to treat hypertension.
   -  Hypertensive urgencies are ideally managed by adjusting maintenance therapies, by adding a new antihypertensive or increasing the dose of the current medication.
   -  Hypertensive Emergency
     *  Nitroprusside is considered the agent of choice, but it can be problematic for patients with CKD. Nitroprusside is metabolized to cyanide and then to thiocyanate, which is eliminated by kidneys. Therefore, serum thiocynate levels should be monitored when infusions are continued for longer than 72 hours.
     *  IV nitroglycerin
     *  Fenoldopam, nicardipine and clevidipine are newer and more expensive agents.
