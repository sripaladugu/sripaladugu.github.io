	<h5>I'm a Principal Scientist at Roche. My background is primarily in Mathematics, Biology, and Pharmacy. My current research focuses on RNA-Seq data analysis, setup of analytics infrastructure for 4th generation sequencing technology. Topics of interest include machine learning, bayesian inference, and data visualization. When I'm not working, I enjoy reading, and spending time with my beautiful wife and lovely son.</h5>
