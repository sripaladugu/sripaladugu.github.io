    "Okay, so now we know how to get data out of the series. Let's talk about working with the data. A common task is to want to consider all of the values inside of a series and want to do some sort of operation. This could be trying to find a certain number, summarizing data or transforming the data in some way. A typical programmatic approach to this would be to iterate over all the items in the series, and invoke the operation one is interested in. For instance, we could create a data frame of floating point values. Let's think of these as prices for different products. We could write a little routine which iterates over all of the items in the series and adds them together to get a total. \n",
    "This works, but it's slow. Modern computers can do many tasks simultaneously, especially, but not only, tasks involving mathematics. Pandas and the underlying NumPy libraries support a method of computation called vectorization. Vectorization works with most of the functions in the NumPy library, including the sum function. "

    "Amazing. Not only is it significantly faster, but it's more concise and maybe even easier to read too. The typical mathematical operations you would expect are vectorized, and the NumPy documentation outlines what it takes to create vectorized functions of your own. One last note on using the indexing operators to access series data. The .loc attribute lets you not only modify data in place, but also add new data as well. If the value you pass in as the index doesn't exist, then a new entry is added. And keep in mind, indices can have mixed types. While it's important to be aware of the typing going on underneath, Pandas will automatically change the underlying NumPy types as appropriate. "

It instead returns a new series which is made up of the two appended together. We can see this by going back and printing the original series of values and seeing that they haven't changed.

    "It's easy to delete data in series and DataFrames, and we can use the drop function to do so. This function takes a single parameter, which is the index or roll label, to drop. This is another tricky place for new users to pandas. The drop function doesn't change the DataFrame by default. And instead, returns to you a copy of the DataFrame with the given rows removed. We can see that our original DataFrame is still intact. This is a very typical pattern in Pandas, where in place changes to a DataFrame are only done if need be, usually on changes involving indices. So it's important to be aware of. Drop has two interesting optional parameters. The first is called in place, and if it's set to true, the DataFrame will be updated in place, instead of a copy being returned. The second parameter is the axis, which should be dropped. By default, this value is 0, indicating the row axis. But you could change it to 1 if you want to drop a column."

    "The common work flow is to read your data into a DataFrame then reduce this DataFrame to the particular columns or rows that you're interested in working with. As you've seen, the Panda's toolkit tries to give you views on a DataFrame. This is much faster than copying data and much more memory efficient too. But it does mean that if you're manipulating the data you have to be aware that any changes to the DataFrame you're working on may have an impact on the base data frame you used originally. Here's an example using our same purchasing DataFrame from earlier. We can create a series based on just the cost category using the square brackets.  "

    "A common workflow is to read the dataset in, usually from some external file. We saw previously how you can do this using Python, and lists, and dictionaries. You can imagine how you might use those dictionaries to create a Pandas DataFrame. Thankfully, Pandas has built-in support for delimited files such as CSV files as well as a variety of other data formats including relational databases, Excel, and HTML tables. I've saved a CSV file called olympics.csv, which has data from Wikipedia that contains a summary list of the medal various countries have won at the Olympics. We can take a look at this file using the shell command cat. Which we can invoke directly using the exclamation point. What happens here is that when the Jupyter notebook sees a line beginning with an exclamation mark, it sends the rest of the line to the operating system shell for evaluation. So cat works on Linux and Macs."

We see that the column values are repeated which really isn't good practice. Panda's recognize this in a panda.1 and .2 to make things more unique. But this labeling isn't really as clear as it could be, so we should clean up the data file. We can of course do this just by going and editing the CSV file directly, but we can also set the column names using the Pandas name property.

    "Boolean masking is the heart of fast and efficient querying in NumPy. It's analogous a bit to masking used in other computational areas. A Boolean mask is an array which can be of one dimension like a series, or two dimensions like a DataFrame, where each of the values in the array are either true or false. This array is essentially overlaid on top of the data structure that we're querying. And any cell aligned with the true value will be admitted into our final result, and any sign aligned with a false value will not. Boolean masking is powerful conceptually and is the cornerstone of efficient NumPy and pandas querying. This technique is well used in other areas of computer science, for instance, in graphics. But it doesn't really have an analogue in other traditional relational databases, so I think it's worth pointing out here. Boolean masks are created by applying operators directly to the pandas series or DataFrame objects. For instance, in our Olympics data set, you might be interested in seeing only those countries who have achieved a gold medal at the summer Olympics.  To build a Boolean mask for this query, we project the gold column using the indexing operator and apply the greater than operator with a comparison value of zero. This is essentially broadcasting a comparison operator, greater than, with the results being returned as a Boolean series."

    "The index is essentially a row level label, and we know that rows correspond to axis zero. In our Olympics data, we indexed the data frame by the name of the country. Indices can either be inferred, such as when we create a new series without an index, in which case we get numeric values, or they can be set explicitly, like when we use the dictionary object to create the series, or when we loaded data from the CSV file and specified the header. Another option for setting an index is to use the set_index function. This function takes a list of columns and promotes those columns to an index. Set index is a destructive process, it doesn't keep the current index. If you want to keep the current index, you need to manually create a new column and copy into it values from the index attribute. Let's go back to our Olympics DataFrame. Let's say that we don't want to index the DataFrame by countries, but instead want to index by the number of gold medals that were won at summer games. First we need to preserve the country information into a new column. We can do this using the indexing operator or the string that has the column label. Then we can use the set_index to set index of the column to summer gold medal wins. "

    "Pandas will search through these in order, finding the distinct data and forming composite indices. A good example of this is often found when dealing with geographical data which is sorted by regions or demographics. Let's change data sets and look at some census data for a better example. This data is stored in the file census.csv and comes from the United States Census Bureau. In particular, this is a breakdown of the population level data at the US county level. It's a great example of how different kinds of data sets might be formatted when you're trying to clean them. For instance, in this data set there are two summarized levels, one that contains summary data for the whole country. And one that contains summary data for each state, and one that contains summary data for each county."

Of course hierarchical labeling isn't just for rows. For example, you can transpose this matrix and now have hierarchical column labels. And projecting a single column which has these labels works exactly the way you would expect it to."
